# workout app 
Design stretching, exercise routines and then use them


## TODOS
[ ] 14 letters / resize name based on length of name. 
[ ] Get "sides" working: switchSides: "alternate" or "interval"
[ ] Make routine picker/put workout data in a different place
[ ] Design UI graphics
[ ] prevent screen from turning off?
[ ] lock rotation? 
[ ] bugs: audio not working
 
## Nice to haves
[ ] Learn svelte native? - Get it on iOS 
[ ] Make routine editor - yaml? 
[ ] Pause, forward, backward
