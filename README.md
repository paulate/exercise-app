## Nice to haves

[ ] Add Custom Rest time to exercise (will alternate between rep and rest) e.g. {name:... reps:... rest:... }
[ ] Add rest time in between exercises e.g. {rest:10}
[ ] lock rotation? 
[ ] Get "sides" working: switchSides: "interval"
[ ] routine editor (yaml?)
[x] prevent screen from turning off? - does not turn off if intervals have audio and are shorter than time off screen
[x] time elapsed/time remaining
[x] top UI timer (?)
[NO] Learn svelte native? 
[x] Get it on iOS
